# $HOE FAQ

### What is $HOE?

A meme coin with a mission: raise funds for a real-world initiative focused on local food system resilience while building a community of meme-loving degens and community gardeners.

### Is this a real project or just for laughs?

Both. The meme is real. The mission is serious. Every trade supports a grassroots movement to fix the food system.

### How can I earn $HOE?

- Participate in contests and meme raids
- Stake $HOE or LP tokens once farming is live
- Contribute and be recognized with “Sadie Supporter” NFTs

### Is there an airdrop?

Yes, but it’s community-based. Early meme activity and engagement will be rewarded fairly. No VC bags, no stealth unlocks.

### Where does the money go?

- Trading fees help fund a real-world initiative focused on local food system resilience
- LP fees go back into the $HOE pool
- No private team dumps — all allocations are transparent and vested

### Will this go to $0?

Maybe. But not before we plant a lot of memes and grow something real.
