# $HOE Fee Structure & GrowOperative Funding Plan

$HOE isn’t just a meme coin — it’s a mission coin. A portion of every transaction helps fund **GrowOperative**, a real-world initiative working to solve food insecurity through local cooperative growing networks. This document outlines the fee system that powers that funding, while keeping the $HOE ecosystem fair, transparent, and fun.

## 🎯 Why Fees?

The fee system is designed to:

- **Fund GrowOperative** in a sustainable and transparent way
- **Discourage early dumping** and bot abuse
- **Reinvest into liquidity** to stabilize $HOE's market
- **Reward long-term holders** and contributors
