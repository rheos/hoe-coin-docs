## Overview

$HOE is a meme-driven fundraising token designed to seed capital for GrowOperative and aligned projects. It launches independently, using humor and viral culture to attract attention and capital from crypto communities. While eventually bridgeable into real-world economic tools (e.g. $BEET or FOAF), $HOE's initial phase is all about hype, liquidity, and community culture.

## Objectives

- Raise $50K‚Äì$250K in launch capital through a meme coin fair launch
- Build community engagement on X (Twitter), Telegram, and web
- Use proceeds to accelerate GrowOperative / FOAF infrastructure
- Maintain brand separation from GrowOperative in early phase
- Transition later into optional DAO governance or utility staking

- **Primary Logo**: Vintage cartoon farm girl, winking, holding a hoe  
- **Design Notes**: One strap off shoulder, expressive face, curvy proportions
