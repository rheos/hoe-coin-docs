## Overview

$HOE is a meme-driven fundraising token designed to seed capital for GrowOperative and aligned projects. It launches independently, using humor and viral culture to attract attention and capital from crypto communities. While eventually bridgeable into real-world economic tools (e.g. $BEET or FOAF), $HOE's initial phase is all about hype, liquidity, and community culture ‚Äî with a real-world impact mission underneath.

---

## Objectives

- Raise $50K‚Äì$250K in launch capital through a meme coin fair launch
- Directly fund GrowOperative using on-chain trading fee mechanics
- Build community engagement on Twitter, Telegram, and web
- Use proceeds to accelerate GrowOperative / FOAF infrastructure
- Maintain brand separation from GrowOperative in early phase
- Transition later into optional DAO governance or utility staking

---

## Identity & Branding

- **Primary Logo**: Vintage cartoon farm girl, winking, holding a hoe  
- **Design Notes**: One strap off shoulder, expressive face, curvy proportions  
- **Color Palette**: Warm earth tones ‚Äî tan, brown, orange, olive  
- **Typography**: Serif `$`, strong kerning, bold sans serif for HOE  
- **Mascot Name Ideas**: Sadie ‚Ä¢ The First Lady of the Hoeconomy

## Promoter Token Vesting Plan

To ensure fairness and prevent early dumping:

- **Promoters receiving >500,000 $HOE** will be subject to **vesting**
- **Standard schedule**:  
  - 3‚Äì6 month vesting  
  - 1‚Äì2 week cliff  
  - Linear unlocks every 2 weeks
- **Emergency clause**: Promoters who ghost or promote rugs forfeit remaining allocations
- **Low-tier contributors** (e.g. meme bounties or shoutouts under 100k‚Äì200k $HOE) may receive immediate rewards at discretion
- Optionally, NFTs may be issued as "Promoter Passes" to track or badge early contributors

---

## Launch Phases

### üîπ Phase 1: Stealth + Community
- Secure domains and Twitter handles ‚úÖ
- Build meme library + community culture
- Drop teaser art and slogans
- Avoid sharing contract address to prevent sniping

### üî∏ Phase 2: Launch Week
- Deploy token on Solana with Anchor smart contract
- Publish DEXTools / GeckoTerminal link
- Trading fees activate instantly with snipe protection
- Airdrop contest, meme competition, ‚ÄúPimp My HOE‚Äù NFT teaser
- Redirect all traffic to `pimpyourhoe.com`

### üî∏ Phase 3: Utility & Evolution
- NFT-based perks for top fee contributors
- Stake $HOE for merch, governance, or whitelist access
- Transition treasury toward FOAF ecosystem or $BEET bridge
- Option to burn remaining $HOE or migrate to next phase

---

## Security Considerations

- Do not announce contract until trading protection is active
- Use burner wallet and deploy early to reserve token name
- Verified metadata + creator address on Solana
- Block bots, contracts, and whales during early trading

Some ideas I could focus on developing with $HOE

üí° $HOE Holding Incentives: "Farming" Concepts

1. üå± Basic HOE Staking
- Stake $HOE to passively earn more $HOE.
- Boost yield for longer staking durations or community participation.

2. ü™¥ NFT-Based Plot Farming
- Stake $HOE + "Plot" NFTs to earn yield.
- Higher-tier plots = better rewards.
- Optional seasonal cycles or harvest bonuses.

3. üíß LP Farming with Protection
- Provide $HOE liquidity and stake LP tokens to farm.
- Add extra incentives like fee rebates or volatility protection for LPs.

4. üßë‚Äçüåæ Yield for Influence
- Instead of just $HOE, farm meme power: voting rights, airdrop multipliers, or access to premium channels.

‚ú® Bonus: Seasonal Farming
- Spring: Cultivate
- Summer: Harvest
- Fall: Burn dead weight
- Winter: Rest and prepare

Holding $HOE = working your plot. Only true farmers earn the good stuff.
