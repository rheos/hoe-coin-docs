# Promoter & Partner Vesting

## Purpose

To avoid early dumping and align promoters with the long-term mission.

## Vesting Rules

- Vest if recipient gets >500,000 $HOE
- Vesting duration: 3–6 months
- Cliff: 1–2 weeks
- Unlock: Linear, every 2 weeks
- Emergency clause: Dumpers or ghosters lose future unlocks
- Small tasks (e.g. under 100k–200k) may be paid immediately

## Optional

- NFT "Promoter Passes" for tracking early backers or collabs


## Emergency Clause – Early Dumper Definition

Any promoter, partner, or collaborator receiving a vested $HOE allocation may forfeit their remaining tokens if they engage in behavior deemed harmful to the launch or long-term value of $HOE.

A participant will be considered an **early dumper** if:

- They sell or transfer **more than 25%** of their received $HOE within the first **30 days** of their vesting schedule **without prior coordination or cause**, *and*
- They make no further effort to promote, engage, or participate in the community or campaign following token receipt, *or*
- They are found to have promoted competing tokens or known scams within the same launch window

This clause will be enforced by the core dev team at its discretion, with documentation. If activated, **all remaining unvested tokens will be revoked** and may be returned to the treasury or redirected to community incentives.
