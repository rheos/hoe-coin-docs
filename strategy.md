# $HOE Project Strategy

## Overview

$HOE is a meme-driven fundraising token designed to seed capital for a real-world initiative focused on local food system resilience and aligned projects. It launches independently, using humor and viral culture to attract attention and capital from crypto communities. While eventually bridgeable into real-world economic tools (e.g. $BEET or FOAF), $HOE's initial phase is all about hype, liquidity, and community culture — with a real-world impact mission underneath.

## Objectives

- Raise $50K–$250K in launch capital through a meme coin fair launch
- Directly fund a real-world initiative focused on local food system resilience using on-chain trading fee mechanics
- Build community engagement on Twitter, Telegram, and web
- Use proceeds to accelerate a real-world initiative focused on local food system resilience / FOAF infrastructure
- Maintain brand separation from a real-world initiative focused on local food system resilience in early phase
- Transition later into optional DAO governance or utility staking
