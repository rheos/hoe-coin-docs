## ðŸ“£ Promoter Terms & Collaboration Policy

Thanks for your interest in supporting **$HOE**.

Weâ€™re not paying for shills. $HOE is a mission-driven meme coin with long-term goals and a real-world funding component â€” not a cash grab. That said, weâ€™re open to working with proven promoters under the right terms.

### âœ… Basic Terms

- **No upfront payments** â€” all collaborations are performance-based  
- **Token rewards only** â€” with vesting unless very small  
- **Vesting applies** to most allocations over 500,000 $HOE  
  - Standard vesting: 3â€“6 months  
  - Cliff: 1â€“2 weeks  
  - Linear unlocks every 2 weeks  
- **Bonuses** may apply for strong reach or verified performance  
- **Optional NFT badges** or roles for standout contributors  
- **Forfeiture clause** applies to early dumpers, ghosters, or bad actors

### ðŸš¨ Early Dumper Clause

Promoters who receive vested tokens may forfeit their remaining allocation if they:

- Sell or transfer more than **25%** of their received $HOE within the first **30 days** *without prior coordination or cause*, **and**  
- Make no further effort to promote, engage, or participate in the community, **or**  
- Are found promoting competing tokens or known scams during the same launch window

This clause is enforced at the discretion of the core team and intended to protect the integrity of the launch.

### ðŸ“Š How We Track Results

We monitor performance using metrics from the X Developer API, including:

- Retweet and like counts  
- Quote tweets and replies  
- New followers gained via promos or mentions  
- On-chain activity during promotion windows (where linkable)

Multipliers may be applied for:

- High organic engagement  
- Proven ability to drive volume or community growth  
- Historical performance or referrals with track record
