# Future Governance & DAO Planning

While $HOE launches with centralized control for safety and speed, the long-term vision is decentralized.

## Phase 1: Memeocracy

- Community votes on memes, taglines, and promo ideas
- MemeDAO can be seeded with a portion of $HOE or NFT sales

## Phase 2: Treasury Influence

- Voting power granted to Sadie Supporter NFT holders or long-term $HOE stakers
- Votes on airdrop rules, farming multipliers, or merch directions

## Phase 3: DAO Transition

- Treasury multisig gradually turned over to trusted community signers
- Governance modules integrated via hoeconomy.com or FOAF governance layer
